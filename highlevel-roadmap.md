# Roadmap

## Purpose

We're looking for an easy way to manage community events and attendance of its 
members. Since traditional calendars don't provide us with all the necessary 
features, this describes an attempt to describe those features.


## Components

We want to realize the following components:
1. A server that exposes all information through a rest service,
2. A one-page rich client web-application that allows all the basic 
   functionality.
3. An android application that allows all the basic functionality.


## Basic Features

1. Manage the community and its members.
2. Plan events,
3. Manage events,
4. Manage event attendance, either by users themselves, validated by community 
   leaders,
5. Report on attendance.

## Android Application

### Features

1. Show notifications if an event is planned,
2. Automatically manage attendance based on location, ie. if a user is at the 
event location at the event time, note as attended.
